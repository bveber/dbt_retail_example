# DBT Retail Example Project

# `Why are we here?`

The purpose of this project is for me (a Machine Learning Engineer) to gain more practical experience
with DBT (and several other tools) while creating a functional demo in a domain I have some experience in.
Maybe someday I will turn this into an interactive demo.

# `What are we doing?`

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide time-series forecasts using a
[publicly available dataset](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy)
from the state of Iowa that documents all transactions between liquor stores and vendors.
This repo currenlty provides monthly-level forecasts for product-categories at each store.
In theory, this could be useful to individual liquor stores to understand future demand in order to make more
intelligent purchasing decisions or for vendors to be better prepared for future orders. Ultimately, this
level of granularity was chosen arbitrarily, potentially trading-off some practical utililty for
data that is easier to work with.

# `How does it work?`

We are using [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt/) to define a number of transformations
required to prepare raw transactional data for a many-models time-series forecasting implementation.
The source data for this project is available as a public-facing
[BigQuery table](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/iowa-department-of-commerce/iowa-liquor-sales),
therefore this project uses the [dbt-bigquery adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup).
The raw data is transformed via BigQuery tables and views before a
[python model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models) uses a package called
[dart](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/) to generate the time-series forecasts. The python models are run in the backend using
[Dataproc Serverless](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs) via a custom container defined
at `dockerfiles/minimal_python_ts` and are materialized as BigQuery tables.

With the appetizer of product soup out of the way, let's dig into the main course.

## `DBT`

DBT's website sums up their product quite succinctly: "dbt™ is a SQL-first transformation workflow
that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices
like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation". This tool is an easy-to-use option for teams looking
to optimize and version-manage their data transformation pipelines that provides a common interface for
Data Engineers, Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists.

### `Project configuration`

The dbt_project.yml file is the primary configuration for your DBT project. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml)

### `Project structure`

For information on best practice for how to structure your models directory review the following docs:

- [DBT best practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview)
- [Staging vs Intermediate vs Mart Models in dbt](https://towardsdatascience.com/staging-intermediate-mart-models-dbt-2a759ecc1db1)

### `Models`

The key component of DBT is the `model`. Models are generally SQL-based transformation and are placed in
the `/models` directory.

### `Python model`

In DBT the most commonly used models are SQL-based transformations. Many Data Engineers and Analysts might
only ever need this type of model. However, many ML pipelines require some amount of python processing.
This can be done using the [python model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models).
DBT allows users to define python transformation via Spark jobs. With our BigQuery adapter
we use [Google Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) to run our jobs.

### `dbt-bigquery adapter`

DBT offers a number of connectors (Redshift, Databricks, Bigquery, etc.) but we will be using the
BigQuery adapter for this project since the source data is already conveniently available in BigQuery. Review the
[docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup) in order to setup this adapter and learn
more about it.

## `Dataproc backend`

In Googles words: "Dataproc is a fully managed and highly scalable service for running Apache Hadoop,
Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Presto, and 30+ open source tools and frameworks. Use Dataproc for
data lake modernization, ETL, and secure data science, at scale, integrated with Google Cloud,
at a fraction of the cost." They offer two modes of operation; fully-managed cluster or serverless.

### `Dataproc cluster`

Google offers the ability to create and maintain a full cluster for running your spark jobs
and the documentation can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster).
But who wants to maintain a clusters? We both know you're going to forget to turn it off and curse the
$10 bill you rack up while it sits idle overnight. For that reason this project has not been tested
with a managed cluster.

### `Dataproc serverless`

Google offers the ability to spin up resources on demand for executing your spark jobs
and the documentation can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs).
Because of the intermittent execution of this project the serverless option is ideal. This
product comes with a standard runtime that comes with unknown versions of the packages
listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs/guides/custom-containers#dockerfile).
For this project we need additional packages for forecasting so we can't use the standard runtime
and will use custom containers instead.

#### `Custom containers`

Google allows you to use a [custom container](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs/guides/custom-containers)
to execute your Dataproc Serverless jobs, enabling us to use our required forecasting packges. The docs show an example
container and make a number of recommendations, but none of it is helpful. Ultimately, a stripped down image,
containing the darts package and pyspark is used in this project. The images need to be build and pushed to
[Artifact Repository](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) for us to use it with our python models.

Note: as of dbt-biguery version 1.5.0b4 custom containers are not supported. However, this is possible using
this [fork](https://github.com/bveber/custom-container-dataproc-serverless). Hopefully, it will be merged
into the source code as a resolution to [this issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/642).

## `Data Science`

This project is done from the perspective of a Machine Learning Engineer, so the Data Science likely leaves a lot
to be desired but this should serve as a good introduction to time-series forecasting. For this project, the forecasts
are made monthly for all combinations stores and product-categories. This fits nicely with the spark runtime
as it allows us to aggregate data at the store/product-category level, then fit and predict with time-series
in each partition.

### `darts`

According to their website: "Darts is a Python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on
time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The forecasting
models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library
also makes it easy to backtest models, combine the predictions of several models, and take external data into account."
This package adds a convenient layer on many different forecasting packages, providing a consistent way to fit and
test multiple forecasting models.

During experimentation it makes sense to download the full package, however it supports many different model
architectures, so unless you intend on using all of them (or at least the most complex ones) it might make sense
to perform testing and validation with darts, but in production it might make sense to use u8darts (the slimmed down version)
or to remove the darts dependency and use only the required packages.

### `Google Colab experimentation`

Google Colab is a notebook environment that integrates nicely with BigQuery and other Google Cloud tools.
This enables data scientists to query a common table or view and experiment with different modeling techniques
in a standard Python runtime. In this project, Data Scientists are encouraged to experiment with different
techniques at a small scale for a few store/product-category combinations before implementing the best solution in
production. The nature of this problem makes it easy to translate code for 1 store/product-category into a function
that can be applied across the entire dataset via pandas_udf.

### `pandas_udf`

In this and similar time-series projects its natural for Data Scientists to perform initial experimentation
on a filtered datasets with a handful of various store/product-cateogory combinations. As long as the output
of the Data Science experimentation results in a function that accepts a pandas dataframe with all data for
one group and returns a pandas dataframe with the forecasts it is incredibly easy to translate Data Science
into for a PySpark job that aggregates at the store/product-cateogory level and applies the function derived by
the DS team. For more details about this workflow review the following docs:

- [applyInPandas](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.GroupedData.applyInPandas.html)
- [pandas_udf](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.2/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.functions.pandas_udf.html)

# `Likely next steps`

As with any project, there are a number of possible improvements that have not been explored yet.
We'll spend some time highlighting some of the more obvious choices.

## `Improve project requirements`

This project provides monthly forecasts at the store/product-category granularity level, but it
might not actually be useful to any possible users of this tool. For the sake of this project,
we are assuming a couple of different potential fictional user, but the first step would
be identifying that actual users. Once, the users are known, it would be importatnt to meet
with them and better understand their needs.

## `Additional data`

This dataset is a great example of retail data, but in most real-world time-series forecasting
projects there will be several other supporting datasets. For example, it would be nice to know
of store closures, so the transaction data can be properly imputed. Moreover, it would be helpful
to know the status of all stores, vendors, categories and items. One known problem in the current
implementation is dead product-categories. It would be nice to know which ones are active so only
the appropriate time-series are used for forecasting.

## `More DS experimentation`

This project has only done a cursory amount of DS experimentation. Only a handful of categories at
two high-volume stores were used for experimentation. It would be good to explore more modeling techniques.
This might include more model architectures at the same granularity, be it univariate or multivariate.

## `Model promotion`

Determine a metric and threshold for succes so Data Scientists can identify superior models that should
be promoted to production.

## `Scale up`

Right now forecasts are generated for all categories at two stores. Doing so would almost certainly surface
unknown data quality issues.
